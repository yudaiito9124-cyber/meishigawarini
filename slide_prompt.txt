Please create a structure and content for a presentation slide deck introducing the web application "Meishigawarini" (名刺がわりに).

## Project Overview
"Meishigawarini" (meaning "Instead of a Business Card" in Japanese) is a digital gift delivery system that bridges the physical and digital worlds. It allows senders (shops or individuals) to distribute physical cards with QR codes. Recipients scan the code, enter a PIN, and provide their shipping address to receive a gift. This eliminates the need for the sender to know the recipient's address in advance.

## Target Audience
- Corporate clients (for promotional gifts)
- Shop owners (as a catalog gift system)
- Developers/Stakeholders (interested in the architecture)

## Key Themes
- Seamless User Experience (Physical to Digital)
- Serverless Architecture (Scalable & Modern)
- Security & Privacy (PIN protection, Secure Data Handling)
